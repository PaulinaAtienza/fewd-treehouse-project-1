        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Canadian expat living in the United States. Because of the global pandemic, I am currently trying to reskill and become a web developer.</p>
        <p>Web design has been an interest of mine since I was a child. In fact, I started learning HTMl and CSS at a very young age! After many years, I have finally decided to pursue web development as an adult and continue my education.</p>
        <p>I've worked in many different job fields, including the retail, legal and surveying fields. I have a Bachelor of Arts in History.</p>
        <p>For more information about my skills, please visit my <a href="experience.html">experience</a> page!</p>
